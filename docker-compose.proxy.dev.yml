# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -f docker-compose.proxy.dev.yml up -d

services:
  # Frontend - no port mapping (handled by reverse proxy)
  frontend:
    ports: []

  # Backend API - no port mapping (handled by reverse proxy)  
  backend:
    ports: []

  # Database - keep port mapping for external access (optional)
  # Comment out the ports section below if you don't need external DB access
